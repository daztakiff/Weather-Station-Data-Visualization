Must have Cinder for drawing purposes and graphics display download this project and add to a projects folder in Cinder so that the configuration is set up

Can use as long as you have a API key from weatherapi.com and current data must be set up to
the current date so that the requests only go back seven days at max

Generally responds to Enter/Return to advance a screen from menu to map to station and Backspace/Delete takes you back a level. Lets you change date and hour time using the down and up arrowkeys.
